# Imbalanced-Learning-on-a-credit-card-transactions-dataset
Even though most of the machine learning algorithms assume as a prerequisite that the data they are dealing with are i.i.d, in real-life, they are not most of the time. In fact, data scientiststs often have to deal with imbalaced datasets. In this repository, I implemented 2 strategies to cope with imbalanced data in the specific case of a credit card transactions dataset
